# GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving

This repository contains the topics covered in the **"GfG 160 - 160 Days of Problem Solving"** course. Each topic in this course focuses on building problem-solving skills in Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Topics Covered:

### 1. **Arrays**
   - Arrays are a fundamental data structure that store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing fast access and manipulation.

### 2. **String**
   - Strings are sequences of characters and are often used to represent text; operations like searching, concatenation, and pattern matching are common.

### 3. **Sorting**
   - Sorting refers to arranging elements in a specified order, either ascending or descending, and is essential for optimizing search operations.

### 4. **Searching**
   - Searching algorithms help in finding an element in a collection, and the most common methods include linear search and binary search.

### 5. **Matrix**
   - A matrix is a two-dimensional data structure where elements are arranged in rows and columns, widely used in problems involving grid-like structures.

### 6. **Hashing**
   - Hashing is a technique used to map data to a fixed-size value, commonly used in hash tables to optimize search, insert, and delete operations.

### 7. **Prefix Sum**
   - The prefix sum is an array derived from the original array, where each element at index `i` represents the sum of elements from the start to index `i`.

### 8. **Two Pointer Technique**
   -  This technique uses two pointers to solve problems involving arrays or lists, such as detecting palindromes, merging sorted arrays, or finding pairs with a given sum.

### 9. **Linked List**
   - A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a reference (or link) to the next element in the sequence, allowing dynamic memory allocation.
